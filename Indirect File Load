Indirect file loading in Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS) allows you to dynamically reference files in mappings or
tasks via parameters or variables, rather than hardcoding file paths or names. This provides more flexibility and
adaptability in your data integration processes.

The key points about indirect file loading in IICS are:

1. It enables you to process multiple files with the same structure and properties using a single source 
transformation in a mapping. 
2. Instead of passing the actual source files as input, you pass a "manifest file" that contains a list of all the
source file names and their directory paths. 
3.There are three main ways to implement indirect file loading in IICS:
 a. Using the "File List" option in the source transformation properties. 
 b. Using the "Command" option in the source transformation properties. 
 c. Using the Data Integration Quick Start Bundle.
4. The manifest file must meet certain requirements:
 a. All files in the list must have the same structure and properties 
 b. The directory path can be specified, otherwise IICS will look for the files in the same directory as the source connection 
 c. The directory paths must be local to the secure agent 
5. Indirect file loading from AWS S3 buckets is also possible, but requires creating a manifest file with the list of S3 file paths. 
6. Indirect file loading provides more flexibility compared to directly specifying each source file, especially
when dealing with large numbers of files with the same structure. 


In summary, indirect file loading in IICS allows you to dynamically process multiple source files through a single mapping
by referencing a manifest file, rather than hardcoding individual file paths. This enhances the agility and
adaptability of your data integration workflows.
